# @charlietango/hooks

The [@charlietango/hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@charlietango/hooks)
module collects all of the individual modules into a single dependency. The module
is optimized for tree shaking, so you application should only include the dependencies
you actually use.

```js
import { useMedia } from '@charlietango/hooks'
```
