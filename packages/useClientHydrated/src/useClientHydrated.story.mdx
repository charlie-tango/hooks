# useClientHydrated

Check if the client has been hydrated. This hook only informs you of the current hydration state, and
doesn't trigger a new render once the client becomes hydrated. To check that, you'd combine it with
a `useEffect` to trigger a new render.

## API

```js
const output = useClientHydrated()
```

## Example

The `hydrated` value is `false` the first time a component with the hook gets rendered. On the
second render it will be true. Try reloading the page to see the effect.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.SSRHydratedState} />
</Canvas>

You can use a `useEffect` to set a `ready` state once the application is ready.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.RehydrateOnClient} />
</Canvas>
