# useId

Generate a deterministic id using a `ContextProvider`.
Use this as a way of generating unique ids for input fields, or linking aria fields.

## API

```js
const id = useId(prefix?: string)
```

The `useId` hook should ideally be wrapped with the `IdProvider`.
This ensures that the generated ids are deterministic, since the provider gets created once for each instance of the application.

The hook will revert to generating the `id` as a side effect if the `IdProvider` is not included. This means you will get back `undefined` during the initial render.

> ⚠️ When using the hook to generate an `id` for an HTML element, make sure you prefix it with fixed string value - otherwise you'll create a global `id` that's just a number.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.ExampleWithProvider} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.ExampleWithoutProvider} />
</Canvas>
