# useInteraction

Monitor the user interactions on an element

## API

```js
const [ref, status] = useInteraction()
```

The hook returns an Array with a `ref` function, and the current interaction `status`.
Assign the `ref` to the element you want to monitor.

### `status`

The status is an object containing a `boolean` for each of the following properties:

- `active` - The user is currently pressing the element, either with the mouse or touch
- `focus` - The element has focus
- `focusVisible` - The focus outline shouldn't be shown - Enabled if using `focus-visible` polyfill
- `focusWithin` - An element inside this element currently has focus. This will also affect the `focusVisible`
- `hover` - The user is hovering over the element with the mouse, or it was touched and still has focus

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Example} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.FocusWithin} />
</Canvas>
