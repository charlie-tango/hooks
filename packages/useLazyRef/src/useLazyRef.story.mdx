# useLazyRef

Create a new `ref` with lazy instantiated value.

This is just a clean reusable helper hook for the common boilerplate:

```js
const value = useRef()
if (!value.current) value.current = init()
```

## API

```js
const result = useLazyRef(() => Result)
```

Once the value has been instantiated, you cannot reset it without recreating the component.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Example} />
</Canvas>
