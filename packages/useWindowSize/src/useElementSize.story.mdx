<Meta title="Hooks/useWindowSize" />

# useWindowSize

Get the current `width` and `height` of the viewport.

## API

```js
const { width, height } = useWindowSize()
```

By default, the value is lazy to support SSR, so the `width` and `height` will always be `0` on the initial render.
Subsequent users of the hook will return the size during the first render.

## Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.WindowSize} />
</Canvas>

Try resizing the browser to see the effect.
